    "<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#61;k9NqhLqKhWQ> can be seen here</a>. Region-by-region, and season-by-season circulation patterns can be seen that govern ocean wave conditions. For example, waves in the northern Pacific and northern Atlantic tend to be driven by large scale circulation blowing from the west. In contrast the tropics are affected seasonally by tropical cyclones that may be much more geospatially compact."

    "A fairly crude comparison of the sampled distribution of $H_s$ can be made through a Q-Q plot of all the (KU-band) satellite observations, and buoy observations. In the figure below, observations from four missions that coincide with the life time of the buoy are compared. Note that buoy 46066 covers the period 2000-2018, so JASON-1 (2002-2013) coincides most completely.\n",
