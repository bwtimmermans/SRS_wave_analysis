# SRS_wave_analysis

# Project start: 01 March 2019
# Funding: UK National Oceanography Center via CCI (EESA)
# Summary:
# This project examines the statistical consistency of observations of ocean surface waves
# captured by a range of satellite missions, by examining the products by Ribal and Young (2019).
# Specific focus is on the examination of temporal trends in the observed significant wave height
# probability distribution, in different global regions.
